What I Learned from This Lab

In this lab, I learned how to break a big problem into smaller reusable parts using functions. I understood how functions improve code structure and make programs more organized and modular.

I also learned how object-oriented programming (OOP) works by creating classes with attributes and methods. The Dataset and Rule-Based Classifier tasks helped me understand how objects can store data and perform operations on that data.

Another important thing I learned was how real-world systems like AI models use rule-based logic and structured pipelines to process and analyze data step by step.

Challenges I Faced

One challenge I faced was properly separating responsibilities between functions. I had to think carefully about which logic should go inside a function and what should remain outside.

In the OOP tasks, understanding how methods access internal data using self was slightly confusing at first. Designing a class that is clean and reusable required careful thinking.

Another challenge was making sure the data cleaning logic correctly handled edge cases, such as negative values or values above the allowed range. I had to ensure no invalid data passed through the system.

Correctness of the Code

The code is logically correct because each function performs a specific task and returns accurate results. The data cleaning function correctly filters values between 0 and 100.

The average calculation functions handle empty lists safely, preventing errors like division by zero.

The class methods correctly operate on internal attributes using proper object-oriented structure. The rule-based classifier correctly compares values with the threshold and returns accurate True/False results.

Overall, the program follows modular design, clear separation of responsibilities, and logically complete conditions, making it structured, reusable, and maintainable.
