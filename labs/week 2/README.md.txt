What I Learned from This Code

In this lab, I learned how to convert real-life situations into programming logic. I understood how to use variables to store data and perform arithmetic operations. I practiced using if-else statements to make decisions in code.

I also learned how to use loops to go through multiple values in a list and apply conditions to each value. The loan eligibility and traffic analysis tasks helped me understand how real-world rules can be modeled using compound conditions and logical operators.

Challenges I Faced

One challenge I faced was handling multiple conditions correctly, especially in the loan eligibility task where income and employment status both needed to be checked together.

Another challenge was making sure that boundary values were handled correctly, such as usage equal to 5 GB or speed equal to 80 km/h. I had to carefully structure the conditions so that no case was missed.

I also needed to focus on initializing counters correctly before using them inside loops.

Correctness of the Code

The code was logically complete because all possible cases were covered in the conditional statements. There were no missing scenarios in the if-elif-else structures.

The counters were initialized properly before the loops, which ensured accurate counting. The percentage calculation in the traffic task used the correct formula.

Overall, the programs were clean, readable, and logically structured, and they correctly followed the given rules.
